I have an [Awesome Uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses) page too. For more geeky setup I highly encourage you to check my [.dotfiles repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/dotfiles).

## Software

For my day-to-day job I use mainly [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Microsoft that I jump on after long years with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) is my favorite Terminal alternative. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) is my tool of choice to help me with REST APIs and GraphQL servers that normally run on separated containers with a little help of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). To debug front-end applications I tend to use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Google Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) when I am playing with some experimental features.

Talented people from Serif help me to escape the monopoly of Adobe applications. The [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) is an amazing alternative to an Illustrator, [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) to a Photoshop and [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/) to an InDesign. [Capture One 12 Pro](https://www.captureone.com/en/) is a tool that helps me a lot with professional look of my photographs. [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files) are my favorite UX tools.

I cannot imagine a productive day of my life without [1Password](https://1password.com/), [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) or [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/). To help me with a smaller tasks I use bunch of other helper apps like:
