Announced at [WWDC 2019](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/) [macOS Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina-preview/) comes with a lot of changes but in all honesty I didn't expect [switching a default shell to zsh (Z shell)](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208050). Since OS X 10.2 Jaguar released in 2002 bash has been the primary operating system shell, so why all the sudden this change? Long story short â€” licensing.

!!! SCREENSHOT OF BASH VERSON !!!

Newer versions of Bash are licensed under the GPLv3 (GNU General Public License version 3) that comes with some restrictions that prevent Apple from adopting a recent version of this command language. Thats the reason why macOS stuck with the last version released under GPLv2 which is 3.2.57 dated back to 2007. Licensed under the MIT License Z shell allows Apple to ship updates to this command language and keep a great level of compatibility with Bash.

Because this is the future of my operating system, I decided to to make a switch right now. Let me share with you how to do it and what are the differences between old-school bash and zsh from the future.
