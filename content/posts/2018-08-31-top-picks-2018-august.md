## [Your skip links are broken](https://axesslab.com/skip-links/)

[Hampus Sethfors](https://twitter.com/hampelusken) published a really great post about "Skip links" that we all tend to implement on out web projects as an accessibility improvement. Turns out that they don't work well on mobile devices. There is a [temporary solution](https://axesslab.com/skip-links#update-a-better-solution) suggested by [Paul J. Adam](https://twitter.com/pauljadam) but it should be fixed by browser developers eventually.

## [CSS Grid Layout Visual Cheatsheet ](http://grid.malven.co/)

This is my new favorite CSS Grid cheat sheet. Thanks [Chris Malven](https://twitter.com/cmalven/)!

## [Blink LazyLoad](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8ZbVyUwgIkQMvJma3kKUDg8UUkLRRdANStqKuOIvHg/edit#heading=h.fuqo94v1qejx)

It is amazing to see that Google Chrome team is actively working on native image / frame lazy loading. It will make such a big impact on web performance! I can't wait for some info from other vendors.
