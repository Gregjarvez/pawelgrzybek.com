From Monday to Friday I am a Senior Front-end Developer at [Mindera](https://mindera.com/) but when it comes to the weekend, I become to be a hobbits photographer. After shooting analog Hasselblad 500C/M for years I recently became a happy owner of [Sony α7R III](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm3). As far as shooting on advanced camera like this is a pure pleasure, to take a good picture you need to have a good eye — this is a common factor for analog and digital worlds. The difference starts after pressing the shutter button when everything instead of going to darkroom, goes to software.

Having a tiny experience with Adobe Camera RAW long years ago, it was a fascinating moment when I had to embrace the world of digital photography in 2018. There is tons of software available on the market: [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom.html), [DxO PhotoLab](https://www.dxo.com/us/photography/photo-software/dxo-photolab) or [Luminar](https://skylum.com/luminar) to name a few big players. All of them are superb but there is always something that I dislike about it: pricing model, performance, missing feature, lack fo camera support etc. There is one that does everything right though.

## Capture One Pro by Phase One

[Capture One](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Highlights.aspx) is designed by the Copenhagen (Denmark) based team of people from Phase One — the absolute leader when it comes to medium format digital photography systems. Creating the best photography hardware for years, gave this bunch of people a solid background to extend an offer by the most powerful and precise software. Let me share with you few reasons why I decided to invest my time and money in their product.

### Price

[Capture One Express](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Sony-Pro.aspx) is a free version of a software for Sony camera owners. For majority of users it is more than enough but to get an access to more powerful features I upgraded to [version Pro](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Features.aspx). There are multiple options in terms of pricing — I ended up buying full license for Sony cameras for only £89. Unfortunately this attractive price applies only to version for Sony cameras. Another good reason to go with mirrorless Sony? Hahaha!

### Learning resources

Software with this level of complexity always requires some learning curve — Capture One Pro is no different. [Learning hub](https://learn.phaseone.com/) contains a comprehensive list of learning resources for beginners, intermediate and advanced users. The form of an app exploration that I like the most are [webinars hosted by David Grover](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZS3EGK3tQ9eNptYkVQlh9hTZ6d-rNOU). These lengthy screencasts are just a perfect connection of comprehensive explainers and practical implementation.

### Sessions

Having disorganized files all over the place is not the best way to keep your collection neat. Having them all in one single catalogue (Lightroom style) doesn't suite my workflow neither. I just want to have a separated event or trip in an encapsulated folder. New way of files organization announced in Capture One 10 called "Sessions" is exactly what I am after. With this workflow, every single session becomes well structured and portable folder that contains all my images and adjustments. It perfectly fits into [my Amazon S3 photo backup solution](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-amazon-s3-photo-backup-solution/). [There is a webinar](https://youtu.be/NdsMo0mKgy4) that thoroughly explains the use case for sessions.

### Customization

Despite a little bit outdated user interface at the first glance, this is probably the most customizable piece of software on my hard drive. You can truly make it yours. Default layout puts everything in well-thought order that works well for me. Following the tabs from left to right, from import to export you have access to hundred little adjustments. A little bit of practice and keyboard shortcuts built into your muscle memory lets you forget about the tool and stay focus on something that matters — photography.

### Performance

I am not running the most expensive, latest iMac Pro with superb powerful GPU and gazillion of RAM. I am on three years old MacBook Pro 15 with 16GB of RAM and Intel Iris Pro 1536MB and this application flies! It requires a few seconds of indexing on initial setup but then my workflow is buttery smooth. I was pretty happy with the performance of version 10, but this is significantly improved in the latest release.

### Process recipes

One for print, another version for my website and of course one to land on the Instagram. Literally three clicks! Process recipes are very customizable, easy to use, intuitive to create and ready to exchange between devices. Literally no other app do it right — Capture One nailed it.

### Layers

You can add up to 16 layers, control their opacity and add literally everything on them (apart from black & white adjustments and spot removal). Concept of layers is nothing new in graphic design software, but it opens a new level of flexibility in RAW processors world. Find out more about [working with layers](https://youtu.be/2WHpVfgC5Qc) on this webinar.

### Advanced Color Editor & Skin Tone 

Simplicity of using advanced color editor and skin tone tool in Capture One Pro makes these two features one of my favorites parts of this software. To achieve similar results in tool like Photoshop, you need to have a lots of color theory knowledge and probably be crazy good at math. Find out more about it on another great webinar by David — [The Color Editor Master Class](https://youtu.be/ZlBLEXe4rPA).

## Give it a go!

There is more to it, but I tried hard to pick my favorite parts of this app without making this article miles long. I cannot wait for new releases and new feature announcements. I wish to have a tiny UI update to make it look a bit more like 2018. History panel (Luminar style like) would be a feature nice to have. I would like to see a more intuitive way to preview before and after changes (I know about clicking the reset button holding option key, but dedicated button would be very appreciated).

This isn't sponsored post whatsoever and I don't work for Capture One (but I would love to though). I just really love this software and I wanted to share with you my experience with it. I am very curious about your opinions, favorite parts, software that you use. Let me know in a comments section below. For know, keep taking now photos and see you soon.
