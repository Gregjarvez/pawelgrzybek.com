## [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/)

Cloudflare and APNIC joined their powers and as a result of this partnership 1.1.1.1 came out. Secure, privacy focused and the fastest ever DNS directory. It takes no time to set it up on your device and you don't have an excuse not to do so. You can find out more details about it on official blogs of both companies: ["Announcing 1.1.1.1: the fastest, privacy-first consumer DNS service"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/) and ["APNIC Labs enters into a Research Agreement with Cloudflare"](https://labs.apnic.net/?p=1127)

Eric Portis from Cloudinary elaborated about a `w` descriptor from `srcset` attribute used in markup for HTML responsive images. It is such a great read an [Observable](https://beta.observablehq.com/) makes it really helpful to understand its complexity. I can't think of a better guy to explain this concept than someone from Cloudinary team.
