From Monday to Friday I am a Senior Front-end Developer at [Mindera](https://mindera.com/) but when it comes to the weekend, I become to be a hobbits photographer. After shooting analog Hasselblad 500C/M for years I recently became a happy owner of [Sony α7R III](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm3). As far as shooting on advanced camera like this is a pure pleasure, to take a good picture you need to have a good eye — this is a common factor for analog and digital worlds. The difference starts after pressing the shutter button when everything instead of going to darkroom, goes to software.

Having a tiny experience with Adobe Camera RAW long years ago, It was a fascinating moment when I had to embrace the world of digital photography in 2018. There is tons of software available on the market: [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom.html), [DxO PhotoLab](https://www.dxo.com/us/photography/photo-software/dxo-photolab) or [Luminar](https://skylum.com/luminar) to name a few big players. All of them are superb but there is always something that I dislike about it: pricing model, performance, missing features, lack fo camera support etc. There is one that does everything right though.

## Capture One Pro - my RAW image converter of choice

[Capture One](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Highlights.aspx) is designed by the Copenhagen (Denmark) based team of people from Phase One — the absolute leader when it comes to medium format digital photography systems. Creating the best photography hardware for years, gave this bunch of people a solid background to develop the most powerful and precise software too. Let me share with you few reasons why I decided to invest my time and money in their product.

### Price

[Capture One Express](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Sony-Pro.aspx) is a free version of a software for Sony camera owners. For majority of users it is more than enough but to get an access to more powerful features I upgraded to version Pro. There are multiple options in terms of pricing — I ended up buying full license for Sony cameras for only £89. Unfortunately this attractive price applies only to version for Sony cameras. Another good reason to go with mirrorless Sony? Hahaha!
