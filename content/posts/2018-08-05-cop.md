From Monday to Friday I am a Senior Front-end Developer at [Mindera](https://mindera.com/) but when it comes to the weekend, I become to be a hobbits photographer. After shooting analog Hasselblad 500C/M for years I recently became a happy owner of [Sony α7R III](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm3). As far as shooting on advanced camera like this is a pure pleasure, to take a good picture you need to have a good eye — this is a common factor for analog and digital worlds. The difference starts after pressing the shutter button when everything instead of going to darkroom, goes to software.

Having a tiny experience with Adobe Camera RAW long years ago, it was a fascinating moment when I had to embrace the world of digital photography in 2018. There is tons of software available on the market: [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom.html), [DxO PhotoLab](https://www.dxo.com/us/photography/photo-software/dxo-photolab) or [Luminar](https://skylum.com/luminar) to name a few big players. All of them are superb but there is always something that I dislike about it: pricing model, performance, missing features, lack fo camera support etc. There is one that does everything right though.

## Capture One Pro by Phase One

[Capture One](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Highlights.aspx) is designed by the Copenhagen (Denmark) based team of people from Phase One — the absolute leader when it comes to medium format digital photography systems. Creating the best photography hardware for years, gave this bunch of people a solid background to extend an offer by the most powerful and precise software. Let me share with you few reasons why I decided to invest my time and money in their product.

### Price

[Capture One Express](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Sony-Pro.aspx) is a free version of a software for Sony camera owners. For majority of users it is more than enough but to get an access to more powerful features I upgraded to [version Pro](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Features.aspx). There are multiple options in terms of pricing — I ended up buying full license for Sony cameras for only £89. Unfortunately this attractive price applies only to version for Sony cameras. Another good reason to go with mirrorless Sony? Hahaha!

### Learning resources

Software with this level of complexity always requires some learning curve — Capture One Pro is no different. [Learning hub](https://learn.phaseone.com/) contains a comprehensive list of learning resources for beginners, intermediate and advanced users. The form of app exploration that I like the most are [webinars hosted by David Grover](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZS3EGK3tQ9eNptYkVQlh9hTZ6d-rNOU). These lengthy screencasts are just a perfect connection of comprehensive explainers and practical implementation. From time to time I participate on those [live sessions](https://www.phaseone.com/Events.aspx?l=webinar&r=showall) and I highly encourage you to do it too.

### Sessions

Having disorganized files all over the places is not the best way to keep your collection neat. Having them all in one single catalogue (Lightroom style) doesn't suite my workflow neither. I just want to have a separated event or trip in an encapsulated folder. New way of files organization announced in Capture One 10 called "Sessions" is exactly what I am after. With this workflow, every single session becomes well structured and portable folder that contains all my images and adjustments. It perfectly fits into [my Amazon S3 photo backup solution](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-amazon-s3-photo-backup-solution/).

### Customization

Despite a little bit outdated user interface at the first glance, this is probably the most customizable piece of software on my hard drive. You can truly make it yours. Default layout puts everything in well-thought order that works well for me. Following the tabs from left to right, from import to export you have access to hundred little adjustments. A little bit of practice and keyboard shortcuts built into your muscle memory lets you forget about the tool and stay focus on something that matters — photography.

Tiny little suggestion to you Capture One people. Tiny UI update would be much appreciated in 2018. Gold for Smooth workspace import/export.

### Performance

I am not running the most expensive, latest iMac Pro with superb powerful GPU and gazillion of RAM. I am on three years old MacBook Pro 15 with 16GB of RAM and Intel Iris Pro 1536MB and this application flies! It requires a few seconds of indexing on initial setup but then my workflow is buttery smooth. I was pretty happy with the performance of version 10, but this is significantly improved in the latest release.
