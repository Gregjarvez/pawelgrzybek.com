## [npm Joins ECMA International and TC39](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/175722319045/npm-joins-ecma-international-and-tc39)

This is kind of a big thing for all JavaScript developers, although the post doesn't clearly explain what kind of benefits we should expect as a developers community. Subject worth to be aware of and follow.

## [Affinity Designer for iPad](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/ipad/)

Have you ever used Affinity Photo? How about Affinity Designer? I love both of them and I use them on a daily basis several years. They are a main reason [why I don't miss Adobe products](https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-wont-miss-you-adobe/). Released last year version of Affinity Photo for iPad is absolutely amazing, and I can't be more excited that Affinity Designer finally landed on Apple's tablet too! This is not everything that guys from Serif announced — desktop version of [Affinity Publisher is coming](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/).

## [Moment - Pro Camera](https://www.shopmoment.com/moment-pro-camera-app)

Not all of you know this but from Monday to Friday I am full time Frontend Developer for [Mindera](mindera.com) but on Saturday and Sunday I enjoy myself taking photos and playing funky records. Photography has always been my big interest and it is probably the most enjoyable part of my life apart from programming. I normally don't use my mobile to take pictures but if I am going to do I am going to use Moment since now on. This app is slick, gives me me a full control over all the settings that T have access to on my professional camera. Highly recommended!

Entire screencast is very interesting but if you don't have a spare hour, I have few takeaways for you.
