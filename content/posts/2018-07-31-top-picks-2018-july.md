## [npm Joins ECMA International and TC39](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/175722319045/npm-joins-ecma-international-and-tc39)

## [Affinity Designer for iPad](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/ipad/)

Have you ever used Affinity Photo? How about Affinity Designer? I love both of them and I use them on a daily basis several years. They are a main reason [why I don't miss Adobe products](https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-wont-miss-you-adobe/). Released last year version of Affinity Photo for iPad is absolutely amazing, and I can't be more excited that Affinity Designer finally landed on Apple's tablet too! This is not everything that guys from Serif announced — desktop version of [Affinity Publisher is coming](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/).
