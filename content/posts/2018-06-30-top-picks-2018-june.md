## [Apple WWDC 2018](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2018/)

Month ago Google I/O, this month it is a time for Apple to introduce some new stuff. This year was all about software with no single mention about any upcoming hardware. As expected, versions of all 4 operating systems has been bumped to: iOS 12, macOS 10.14 Mojave, watchOS 5, tv 4K. I am not an Apple TV user and a little hater of Apple watch so I wan't touch on these two, but I am more than happy to highlight the things that I am the most excited about in new mobile and desktop operating system.

MacOS 10.14 Mojave introduces a frequently requested dark mode and it is looking stunning! It is not just a menu bar and a dock — real dark mode of a whole UI. Security and privacy improvements that are coming to Safari are impressive — cookies and fingerprint tracking turned off by default. Redesigned App Store with a video previews — bang on! Continuous camera and and videos option built into screen shot taking app are looking cool.

Mobile system — iOS12 — supports the same models as the previous one but does it twice faster. Improvements in AR functionality are impressive and a new format designed in collaboration with Adobe will change the world of 3d models used in augmented reality. Adobe is just about to drop a support for AMDZ for core Adobe CC tools. Shortcuts — a new app based on well known Workflow that apple acquired last year — integrates with Siri and allows users to build a complex macros to increase our productivity via single command. Probably the most excited to me: grouped notifications! Do not disturb and notifications are getting more powerful and will get a more precise control level. Grouped faceTime — finally!

## [Cards](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/)

[Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks) published another post in a series about [inclusive components](https://inclusive-components.design/). This time is about commonly used card component. You would have never thought about the details that Heydon covered in this article. Apart from cards related details there is tons of interesting facts on top it. For example — there is a use case when alt tag can be safely skipped from image tag! interesting, isn't it?

## [Specificity in :not(), :has(), and :matches()](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2018/06/05/specificity-in-not-has-and-matches/)

CSSWG (CSS Working Group) recently decided about the specificity of `:not()`, `:has()`and `:matches()` pseudo selectors. [Eric A. Meyer](https://twitter.com/meyerweb) explains all the rules. If you are not sure what a CSS specificity is, the ["CSS specificity explained/"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/css-specificity-explained/) that I published 3 years ago should enlighten the term a little bit.
