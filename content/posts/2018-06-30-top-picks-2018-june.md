## [Apple WWDC 2018](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2018/)

Month ago Google I/O, this month it is a time for Apple to introduce some new stuff. This year was all about software with no single mention about any upcoming hardware. As expected, versions of all 4 operating systems has been bumped to: iOS 12, macOS 10.14 Mojave, watchOS 5, tv 4K. I am not an Apple TV user and a little hater of Apple watch so I wan't touch on these two, but I am more than happy to highlight the things that I am the most excited about in new mobile and desktop operating system.

MacOS 10.14 Mojave introduces a frequently requested dark mode and it is looking stunning! It is not just a menu bar and a dock — real dark mode of a whole UI. Security and privacy improvements that are coming to Safari are impressive — cookies and fingerprint tracking turned off by default. Redesigned App Store with a video previews — bang on! Continuous camera and and videos option built into screen shot taking app are looking cool.

Mobile system — iOS12 — supports the same models as the previous one but does it twice faster. Improvements in AR functionality are impressive and a new format designed in collaboration with Adobe will change the world of 3d models used in augmented reality. Adobe is just about to drop a support for AMDZ for core Adobe CC tools. Shortcuts — a new app based on well known Workflow that apple acquired last year — integrates with Siri and allows users to build a complex macros to increase our productivity via single command. Probably the most excited to me: grouped notifications! Do not disturb and notifications are getting more powerful and will get a more precise control level. Grouped faceTime — finally!

CSSWG (CSS Working Group) recently decided about the specificity of `:not()`, `:has()`and `:matches()` pseudo selectors. [Eric A. Meyer](https://twitter.com/meyerweb) explains all the rules. If you are not sure what a CSS specificity is, the ["CSS specificity explained/"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/css-specificity-explained/) that I published 3 years ago should enlighten the term a little bit.
