## [React Fire: Modernizing React DOM](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525)

[Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) shared future plans for modernizing React COM called "React Fire". Some of the major changes are: mirror the browser behavior of input's `value` attribute, attaching events on a React root component instead of `document`, migration from `onChange` to `onInput`, events system simplification, `class` instead of `className` and more. Unfortunately these innovations will introduce some breaking changes therefore we should expect them in next major release. Following the trend of other modern UI libraries, we ay say "goodbye" to Internet Explorer 11 support. 

> React Fire is an effort to modernize React DOM. Our goal is to make React better aligned with how the DOM works, revisit some controversial past decisions that led to problems, and make React smaller and faster.

## [Practical CSS Scroll Snapping](https://css-tricks.com/practical-css-scroll-snapping/)

In my opinion hiding content from user is an anti-pattern but is is unavoidable on some projects so Front End developers came out with multiple solutions over the years. Carousels is one of the solutions that is one of the most frequently used choices — I even built one [quite popular one](https://pawelgrzybek.github.io/siema/). It is an anti-pattern — don't use it! There is a better way now — native and 100% CSS. This article is one of the best resources out there.

## [GitHub Pull Requests in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/09/10/introducing-github-pullrequests)

Since now on you can manage GitHub PRs straight from my favorite code editor. VS Code is getting better and better — shame that I mainly deal with GitLab nowadays because I wish to use this feature more often than I can.
