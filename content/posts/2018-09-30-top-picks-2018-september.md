## [React Fire: Modernizing React DOM](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525)

[Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) shared future plans for modernizing React COM called "React Fire". Some of the major changes are: mirror the browser behavior of input's `value` attribute, attaching events on a React root component instead of `document`, migration from `onChange` to `onInput`, events system simplification, `class` instead of `className` and more. Unfortunately these innovations will introduce some breaking changes therefore we should expect them in next major release. Following the trend of other modern UI libraries, we ay say "goodbye" to Internet Explorer 11 support. 

> React Fire is an effort to modernize React DOM. Our goal is to make React better aligned with how the DOM works, revisit some controversial past decisions that led to problems, and make React smaller and faster.
