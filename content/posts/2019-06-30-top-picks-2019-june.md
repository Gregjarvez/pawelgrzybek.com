## [WWDC19 - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/)

Annual event for developers by Apple brought lots of great things. My top highlights are: [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), Apple as a identity provider and this little section of docs about [changing the default shell on your Mac to zsh](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208050). I highly encourage all developers interested in this ecosystem to watch at least an opening ceremony.
