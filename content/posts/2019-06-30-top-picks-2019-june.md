## [WWDC19 - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/)

Annual event for developers by Apple brought lots of great things. My top highlights are: [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), Apple as an identity provider and this little section of docs about [changing the default shell on your Mac to zsh](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208050). I highly encourage all developers interested in this ecosystem to watch at least an opening ceremony.

## [Plugins are coming to Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/plugins-are-coming-to-figma/)

This is a big announcement for all Figma users. Sketch app plugin ecosystem is an incredible place to find a little code snippets to boost our workflow — similar concept is coming to Figma. Built with technologies that we all know and like (HTML & JavaScript) we can get involved front-end devs. Let's do it!
