## [Pitching Your Writing To Publications](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/08/pitching-writing-publications/)

Recording videos, running personal blog and tweeting helpful stuff are helpful to gain a recognition but writing for reputable services is a next step in leveling in this industry. [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) writes down a great article full of advices how to do it right. From submitting a post, writing pitch, outlining article to creating a quick bio. Very helpful article!

## [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes)

I listen to a lot of podcast but very rarely I come across one that I am willing to recommend and share with other people on my website. This one definitely deserves for recognition. Command Line Heroes by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) is podcast about the history of programming languages. Short informative and very interesting.
