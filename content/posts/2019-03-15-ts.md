- serverless is becoming more and more popular
- more and more services allow you to buls serverless architectures
- scale, cheap
- myself from frontend to backend

## Prerequisite

- knowledge one of the languages supported by AWS Lambda (i will be using javascript)
- support for other languages is possible bit this is advances subject and it is not part of this article
- aws account, card required, free tier is generous enough to let us play
- brew or equivelent tool for your operating system co install some cli tools

## What are we going to buils and hqt are we going to use

- very simplified API that
- few aws services
- few little local tools
- setup is intense but it pays back on the end

### AWS services in use

- s3
- lambda
- gateway api
- dont need to care about each of them individually now â€” cloudformation can help us with it

### tools that we are going to use locally

- aws cli
- brew
- node
- code editor (vscode for me)
- rest api client to test it like postman or insomnia

## setup credentials and region for aws cli

- aws acount
- get secret key and secret token
- show command
- describe what it does
-

## what is lambda and build one

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/programming-model-v2.html
- function
- takes and 3 args
- triggered by event source, typically other aws service
- can have multiple sources
- can be run in multiple runtimes (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html) - node, python, ruby, java, go, .net and you can even create your own runtime but it is more advanced subject that we are not going to explore
-

## test lambda locally

- write some tests using jest (unit test)
- mention AWS sam cli that help a lot to test lambdas locally but it is a subject for a next article

## deploy lambda to CloudFormation

- describe what is happening
