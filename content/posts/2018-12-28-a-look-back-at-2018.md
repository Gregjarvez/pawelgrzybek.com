Not about a JavaScript — not about a programming at all. Nor about a photography, about the graphic design neither. Today is the day for an exceptional post to recap my achievements and fails from the past year and reveal some plans for a next one. I cultivate this ritual for few years (["A look back at 2016"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/a-look-back-at-2016/) and ["A look back at 2017"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/a-look-back-at-2017/)) and couldn't let this tradition fall apart so I am coming with this year update.

## Professional

I spent nearly two years with smart and inspiring people from [Engine Creative](https://www.enginecreative.co.uk/). The natural need to progress drove me to leave the business and not long after that I joined [Mindera](https://mindera.com/) as a Senior Front End Developer. Meeting bunch of extremely talented and passionated people makes me think that it was the best thing that happened to me this year. I revealed a bit more secrets about this change in ["Thanks for everything Engine Creative! Hi Mindera!"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/thanks-for-everything-engine-creative-hi-mindera/) published on May this year.

Just by looking at [my GitHub contributions graph](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek) I can see that it was my the most hard-working year ever — doesn't feel like it but I contributed 70% more than year before. I published nearly 30 articles on my personal website this year, released [PinBuddy — Google Chrome extension for Pinboard](https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-built-a-thing-pinbuddy/) and actively continued supporting my open source software that helps thousands of people around the world everyday.

One of the most mature professional achievements of this year is the fact that I learned how to chill out. I accepted the fact that I will never catch all the fascinating Twitter news. I won't have a chance to use all hot frameworks from the top of Hacker News and there is no chance to attend to all conferences around the world. Sounds oxymoron-like but I am conscious that I am doing more by doing less.

## Personal

Yes! I'm a truly happy man! I said that year ago and I cannot be happier that nothing changed on this aspect. I still share my life with the most beautiful inside and outside person seen on this globe. I visited few cool places, I ate few amazing meals and bought myself few cool gadgets.

I don't live in Northampton anymore and I cannot be happier to tell you that I can't wait to have a coffee or a beer with you in Leicester. Although it is very convenient to live few minutes away from my office, the thing that I am the most excited about is a change. New places to explore and people to meet!

I am very happy that my passion to photography reborn. There is nothing more relaxing for me than sipping a great coffee and messing around with my favorite [Capture One Pro](https://pawelgrzybek.com/capture-one-pro-the-best-parts/) and raw files taken on my mirrorless Sony camera. You can occasionally see some of my snaps on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pawelgrzybek/).

## Plans for 2019

Professionally — I am not planing to slow down. I am committing myself to built a good open-source software, write articles that help people solve programming challenges and being involved in the process of making the web a better place. There is a plan to release something bigger in few months time — it will be a subscription-based (very cheap) little SaaS (Software as a Service) product. I can't tell you more just now but be assured it will be very cool.

Looking at the personal aspects there is a thing that I am truly unhappy about and this is my biggest challenge for the upcoming moths. I am not feeling happy on my own body. My weight is like a little roller coaster, so my mental comfort is. I am definitely missing some regular activities that could help my body to recover its shape and my brain to not to let me down with no particular reason. I want my six-pack back.

Most importantly, next year this time I would like to confirm that I am truly happy man again. I wish that myself an my family stay healthy with a wide smile on a face. There is one more thing, but let me keep something for myself and share with you some secret life achievement at the right moment.

Thank you for reading my friend. I wish you fantastic 2019!
