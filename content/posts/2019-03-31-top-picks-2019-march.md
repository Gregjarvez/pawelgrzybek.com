## [KV Storage, the Web's First Built-in Module](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/03/kv-storage)

Web platform offers few ways of storing data. The most popular is slow and synchronous [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) followed by pain-full to use [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). The first standard JavaScript library (built-in module) is coming to address this issues — [KV Storage](https://wicg.github.io/kv-storage/). [Import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) are here to help to resolve a path to a module. This great article by [Phil Walton](https://twitter.com/philwalton) explains all of these.
