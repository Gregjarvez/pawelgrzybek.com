Are you waiting for next big thing in CSS? There you go.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The CSS Working Group agreed this morning on adding many math functions.

## [KV Storage, the Web's First Built-in Module](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/03/kv-storage)

Web platform offers few ways of storing data. The most popular is slow and synchronous [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) followed by pain-full to use [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). The first standard JavaScript library (built-in module) is coming to address this issues — [KV Storage](https://wicg.github.io/kv-storage/). [Import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) are here to help to resolve a path to a module. This great article by [Phil Walton](https://twitter.com/philwalton) explains all of these.

## [Sketch raises \$20m in Series A funding from Benchmark](https://blog.sketchapp.com/sketch-raises-20m-in-series-a-funding-from-benchmark-ea298764d7d1)

A big announcement and official confirmation — team collaboration and Sketch in the browser are coming in 2019. I cannot wait for it.

## [Designing An Aspect Ratio Unit For CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/aspect-ratio-unit-css/)

Do you remember a CSS padding hack to implement responsive `iframe` / `embed`? The CSS Working Group is working on much more elegant solution for this issue — `aspect-ratio` property. [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) does a fantastic job by presenting a problem and suggesting a solution. This is part of very early drafts of [CSS Sizing Specification Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-4/#ratios) — please, don;t event try using it yet. It has not been implemented to any browser yet.
