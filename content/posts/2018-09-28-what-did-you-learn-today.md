Since I joined [Mindera](https://mindera.com) few months ago I cultivate a daily habit that I randomly initiated on one of my first days withing a new workplace. At some point of the day I ask my team members…

> What did you learn today?

Whenever you've been asked it your first initial answer is probably "yyy, nothing". Then you do a quick scan of all the challenges that you came accross during the day and you realise that…

> I learned about CSS `cursor` property.

or

> I found out [this tweet](https://twitter.com/thekitze/status/1029369487685021696) that shows how to print something to console without converting arrow functions body.

or 

> I leaned about the difference between `encodeURI()` and `encodeURIComponent`.

We, software developers, are extremally previleged that we work in an industry where people share knowledge willingly. Blog posts, youtube tutorials, conference talks… Embrace it with your colleagues and you will be souprised how many new things you can learn just bu cultivating a similar habit within your organization.
