Two years ago I was really lucky that I joined the team of [Engine Creative](https://www.enginecreative.co.uk/). Bunch of creative, smart and inspiring people motivated to deliver top quality work to endless list of clients. During this time I had a pleasure to work on multiple projects that nearly melted my brain, exploring a hell of a lot of bleeding edge technologies in the same time. I would like to thank you all for this time and wish you all the best in the future!

Time moves on, life perception shapes itself and list of priorities changes its order. The amount of time, passion and dedication that I put into software development drove me to a change bigger than I expected. I would like to proudly announce thatâ€¦

## I'm joining Mindera

Founded in 2014 [Mindera](https://mindera.com/) is a Porto (Portugal) based company that managed to expand and open branches in Leicester (UK), Chennai (India) and San Diego (US). They say "hello", they talk to each other, they smile, [they  take naps](http://tinyurl.com/zc599tr). Am I not a perfect fit?
