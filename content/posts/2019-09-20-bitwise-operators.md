We (humankind) tend to use the decimal numeral system (base-10). Computers deeply are significantly less complex than people because they operate using binary numeral system (base-2). Central processing unit (CPU) of every single computer is made of gazillion transistors and they can store only two possible values, `0` or `1`. The smallest computing unit that describes if the transistor is on or off is a [Bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit).

A bitwise operator is an operator used to perform bitwise operations on bit patterns or binary numerals that involve the manipulation of individual bits.

- you may recognise this blog from javascript relater programming concepts
- today about a subject that has a broaded usage in lower level programming languages, but there is a lot use cases to take advantage of if in JS too
- to understand bitwise operators we first have to understand
