## [Microsoft is building a Chromium-powered web browser that will replace Edge on Windows 10](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10)

Chromium based Anaheim is a direct replacement for Microsoft Edge that will land on a Windows 10 at some point in 2019. This is a big change as the default HTML rendering engine will be replaced with the one that powers the most popular browser on the world Google Chrome. There is no info about the future of Chakra — JavaScript layer used by Microsoft developers. Personally I would like it to be replaced with V8 but I doubt it is going to happen. Cannot wait for further info about this release.
