## [Microsoft is building a Chromium-powered web browser that will replace Edge on Windows 10](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10)

Chromium based Anaheim is going to be a replacement for Microsoft Edge that will land on a Windows 10 at some point in 2019. This is a big change as the default HTML rendering engine will be replaced with the one that powers the most popular browser on the world Google Chrome. There is no info about the future of Chakra — JavaScript layer used by Microsoft developers. Personally I would like it to be replaced with V8 but I doubt it is going to happen. Cannot wait for the further info about this release.

After reading ["How Does React Tell a Class from a Function?"](https://overreacted.io/how-does-react-tell-a-class-from-a-function/) by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) on his new personal blog I decided to read rest of articles. The way how Dan explains complex concepts in simple words is amazing. I highly recommend following his blog to all JavaScript enthusiasts (non only React framework users).

Today platform becomes even more powerful. Adding abilities to easily build custom blocks by developers the possibilities are endless. Can't wait for the new ideas that Wordpress community is going to come out with.
