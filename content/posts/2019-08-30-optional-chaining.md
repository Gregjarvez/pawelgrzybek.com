- proposal
- highly possible get merged in 2020
- lets have a look at the problem that this proposal is solving

## What is chaining, why do we need it and what is the problem with it?

- you get a nested object and you want to reference propoerty deeply nested
- you cannot be assurued that prop always exists (api response, not consistent data layer or simply something is optional in a collection)
- then reference something that exists we get a value otherwise we het a ref error app craches server stops, we are asleep and we are loosing million dollars over night, we get a depresion and we die
- there are few options tho

## How did we historically solve chaining issue

- chaining
- lodash
- other libraries (do a research)
- if statetments
- nice we have all those optionas but it is so commmon it would be nice to have it built to the language â€” and there you go

## Thanks JavaScript for Optional Chaining
