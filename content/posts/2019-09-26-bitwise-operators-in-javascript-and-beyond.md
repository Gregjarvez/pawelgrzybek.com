We (humankind) tend to use the decimal numeral system (base-10). Computers deeply are significantly less complex than people because they operate using binary numeral system (base-2). Central processing unit (CPU) of every single computer is made of gazillion transistors and they can store only `0` or `1`. The smallest computing unit that describes if the transistor is on or off is a [Bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit). By itself a bit isn't too comprehensive, but more complex information units like [Byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) allow us to store a lot more data variations (256 to be precise).

Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing are basic skills for performing  some basic maths operations in a world of decimal numbers. As mentioned before, computers don't understand decimals although they do really well with binaries. Bitwise operators are irreplaceable to perform some operations on `0`s and `1`s.

Although JavaScript being high-level programming language doesn't often require developers to care about such a low-level details, having a basic grasp of it may put your software development skills to the next level. Let's explore the power of bitwise operators and present few practical use cases using JavaScript language. Before that lets cover a necessary prerequisite.

## Numeral Systems

What if I told you that `10010011`, `147` and `93` represent exactly the same value? Thats right, the only difference is the system of numeration. There is multiple ways of expressing a number in mathematics and computer science and I highly encourage you to read more about the subject of [numeral system on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system).

[Radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix), commonly referred as a "base", is the number of unique symbols used to represent a numeral value in [positional  numeral systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system#Positional_systems_in_detail). Let me go through few commonly used in software development and real life. 

### Decimal Numeral System (Base-10)

What is the easiest way of representing a numeral value? Of course â€” by your fingers! That is most likely the reason why [decimal numeral system ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal) became the most commonly used one since the time of ancient civilizations. Although I mentioned that computers deeply operate using binary values only, numeric values are usually converted to decimal representation for the end user convenience.
