We (humankind) tend to use the decimal numeral system (base-10). Computers deeply are significantly less complex than people because they operate using binary numeral system (base-2). Central processing unit (CPU) of every single computer is made of gazillion transistors and they can store only two possible values, `0` or `1`. The smallest computing unit that describes if the transistor is on or off is a [Bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit). By itself a bit isn't too comprehensive, but more complex information units like [Byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) allow us to store a lot more data variations (256 to be precise).

Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing are basic skills for performing  some basic maths operations in a world of decimal numbers. As mentioned before, computers don't understand decimals although they do really well with binaries. Bitwise operators are irreplaceable to perform some operations on `0`s and `1`s.

Although JavaScript being high-level programming language doesn't often require developers to care about such a low-level details, having a basic grasp of it may put you on a next level. Let's explore the power of bitwise operators and present few practical use cases using JavaScript language. Before that lets cover a necessary prerequisite.
