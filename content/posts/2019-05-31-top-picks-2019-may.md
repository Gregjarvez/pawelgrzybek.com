## [Flutter: a Portable UI Framework for Mobile, Web, Embedded, and Desktop](https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/Flutter-io19.html)

Google I/O every year brings a lot of exciting news in the software and hardware world. One of the coolest one is Flutter that is no longer a tool to build efficient multi-platform mobile applications but also for Web and desktop platforms. I have a very little experience with this Dart-based framework but I am extremely keen to have a great purpose to get my hands dirty with it. Some time ago React Native would be me my platform of choice to build a mobile app. Things changed â€” thanks to Flutter.

I had a pleasure to meet [Ives van Hoorne](https://twitter.com/compuives) on [typeof conference](https://typeofconf.com/) in March. This young and extremely talented dude built a CodeSandbox because he was bored on Java lectures at uni. Today CodeSandbox raises $2.4M and I am really looking forward to the future of this amazing tool. Every single time I use it, it welcomes me with a bunch of new powerful features. Keep on doing amazing job CodeSandbox team!

## [Google Fonts will soon support setting font-display](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1126370518347608065)

Thanks [Addy](https://twitter.com/addyosmani) for this amazing news! We have been waiting for this feature for ages and this is the only reason why I use self-host typefaces on my personal projects. Can't wait to be able to use the library of Google Fonts again like in good old days.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸ“¢ Announcing Google Fonts will soon support setting `font-display` via a new query parameter. This unlocks controlling web font loading without having to self-host!

## [Hands-on with Portals: seamless navigations on the Web](https://web.dev/hands-on-portals/)

One of the most appealing parts of SPAa (single page applications) are the transitions between the pages. New HTML `portal` tag opens this feature to MPAs (multi page applications). I am surprised how easy it is to implement and use. I cannot wait to see this feature used in the wild.
