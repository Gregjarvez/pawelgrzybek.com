## [Flutter: a Portable UI Framework for Mobile, Web, Embedded, and Desktop](https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/Flutter-io19.html)

Google I/O every year brings a lot of exciting news in the world of software and hardware. One of the coolest one is Flutter that is no longer a tool to build efficient multi-platform mobile applications but also for Web and desktop platforms. I have a very little experience with this Dart-based framework but I am extremely keen to have a great purpose to get my hands dirty with it. Some time ago React Native would me my platform of choice to build a mobile app. Things changed — thanks to Flutter.
