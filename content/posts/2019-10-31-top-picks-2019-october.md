## [Introducing Sass Modules](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-sass-modules/)

I am very glad to see this software is still actively maintained and new features are being added. Sass Modules is a fascinating concept that should be familiar to developers proficient with any programming language that has a concept of modules. [Miriam Suzanne](https://twitter.com/mirisuzanne) published a great introduction to new feature on [CSS-Tricks](https://twitter.com/css).
