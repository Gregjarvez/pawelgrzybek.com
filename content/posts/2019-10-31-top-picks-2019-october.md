## [Introducing Sass Modules](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-sass-modules/)

Everything that is happening within a CSS in JS space excites me so much but good old plain Sass is still one of my favourite ways of authoring styling. I am very glad to see this software is still actively maintained and new features are being added. Sass Modules is a fascinating concept that should be familiar to developers proficient with any programming language that has a concept of modules. [Miriam Suzanne](https://twitter.com/mirisuzanne) published a great introduction to the new feature on [CSS-Tricks](https://twitter.com/css).

## [Stephen Cook - 100% CSS Mario Kart](https://vimeo.com/364369506)

[Stephen Cook](https://twitter.com/StephenCookDev) built Mario Kart using CSS only. The idea of using `:valid` and `:invalid` `input` for controlling Mario is just genius! This is a very non-production-ready piece of code is amazing and reminds me of one very important thing about my job — keep it fun!
