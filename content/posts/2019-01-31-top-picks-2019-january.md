## [Making Future Interfaces: Algorithmic Layouts](https://youtu.be/qOUtkN6M52M)

[Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks), a big accessible web advocate and author of my favorite book about the subject — ["Inclusive Design Patterns"](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns). He produced a lot of good video content recently and the video about modern layout techniques is the outstanding one in my eyes. Very good breakpoint-less methods and funny sense of humor. HHighly recommended channel to follow.
