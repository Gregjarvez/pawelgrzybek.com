## [Making Future Interfaces: Algorithmic Layouts](https://youtu.be/qOUtkN6M52M)

[Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks), a big accessible web advocate and author of my favorite book about the subject — ["Inclusive Design Patterns"](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns). He produced a lot of good video content recently and the video about modern layout techniques is the outstanding one in my eyes. Very good breakpoint-less methods and funny sense of humor. HHighly recommended channel to follow.

## [GitHub now gives free users unlimited private repositories](https://thenextweb.com/dd/2019/01/05/github-now-gives-free-users-unlimited-private-repositories/)

GitHub with free private repositories — finally! Everything that Microsoft is doing in last few years is amazing, and this one is another step that pushed this industry forward. Up to three users collaboration on private project is the only restriction for free tier accounts. In this situation I will probably say goodby to BitBucket as this news suits all my private version control needs.
