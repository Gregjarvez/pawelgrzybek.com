## [Welcome to Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/)

Sir Tim Berners-Lee — the creator of World Wide Web — announced the Solid ecosystem. The motivation and the way it works seems to be well-thought. I still don't understand it thoroughly but it is definitely a thing that is worth to follow.

## [Create React App 2.0: Babel 7, Sass, and More](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/01/create-react-app-v2.html)

Year’s worth of improvements in a single dependency update just announced by React team. New version of React starter kit comes bundled via WebPack 4 and contains things like: Babel 7, Jest 23, Sass and CSS Modules support and tons of under the hood improvements.

## [Modern Web Podcast - Houdini](https://youtu.be/QbHJIybbPLM)

The state of Houdini project with core contributor [Das Surma](https://twitter.com/dassurma). About the Houdini basics, worklets and its API. Everything that you need to know about its current state in a single screencast.

## [Typekit is Adobe Fonts](https://theblog.adobe.com/typekit-is-adobe-fonts/)

Seven years ago TypeKit has been acquired by Adobe. Since then product was slowly merging into an Adobe ecosystem and today probably the biggest change happened. It is not a TypeKit anymore — say hello to Adobe fonts. No more page-views and domain limits. Sounds really cool for all Adobe Creative Cloud owners.

## [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

Back in the days GitHub pages was a killer in terms of free hosting for static websites. Then players like Netlify came around and changed the game drastically by offering more cool features at a very low cost (or for free). Now enter the GitHub Actions. They allow you to stream your workflow by hooking GitHub events to simple but powerful commands created by little snippets of code or via GUI. I cannot wait to play a bit with this feature and possibly publish some primer on this website very shortly. If you wan't to find out more, I can't recommend enough [Introducing GitHub Actions](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-github-actions/) by [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo).

## [The Intl.RelativeTimeFormat API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/intl-relativetimeformat)

[Mathias Bynens](https://twitter.com/mathias) explains a very exciting spec that is slowly joining the Internationalization API — `RelativeTimeFormat`. If you have ever tried to print on your web app a phrase like "yesterday" or "4 weeks ago" you know how hard this is. Moment.js was my answer for it for years — it comes with some disadvantages tho — performance. This method is going to be helpful. Great explained by Mathias from V8 team.
