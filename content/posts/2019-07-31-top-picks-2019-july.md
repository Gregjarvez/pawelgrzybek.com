There is no chance that I will ever ask my users to download expensive client-side scripts in order to provide me some very inaccurate insights about my traffic. My beloved hosting company [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) just announced something that caught my interest though — [Netlify Analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/). It is privacy-sensitive, with no performance penalty, doesn't require configuration, server-side tool to monitor trends in page-views, visitors, sources and more. All this available for $9 per site per month. Maybe it is not the cheapest solution but definitely the one closest to my requirements. I will be more than happy to openly share some numbers about this website very soon.
