You are planing to learn some new technology — [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for example — so you need to download it first. You visit a projects website, you download an installer, go through the procedure. Next, next, next, done. You may need some database at some point — [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) works really well with it. Again — visit a projects website, download an installer… You know what?! [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is hot. Again — visit a projects website, download an installer…

As a software developer you are going to do a lot of this monotonous tasks like: installing and removing software, switching a version of dependency, searching and trying new tools. There must be a better way than doing all these things manually! Good news — there is one. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the missing package manager for macOS.

```
brew install node mongodb
```

```
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

## Package managers

Concept of command line tools to manage packages isn't new. Probably the `apt-get` from Ubuntu systems is the most widely used one. [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) are equivalents for Windows users. As a macOS user [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is the one that I will guide you through, but I am sure that you can follow along and find equivalent commands for your operating system of choice.

Programming languages have their own ecosystems and their own package managers to manage project components. Mentioned above [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are often used by JavaScript developers, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) makes life of PHP developers much easier and [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) is the best friend of Python developers. This ["Comparison of Programming Language Package Managers"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12187888) HN thread is the place to go to find out more about them.

On the end of the day all package managers do the same job — make your life easier and boost your productivity by removing tedious tasks from your workflow.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with command line would be cool. You don't need to be Terminal ninja with the most complex `.vimconfig` file on a whole GitHub. As long as you know what `ls`, `cd` and `pwd` are, you are ready to go. If not, go and grab a copy of ["Working the Command Line" by Remy Sharp](https://remysharp.com/2016/12/09/working-the-command-line) and come back later on.

## Brew and its most popular commands

[Homebrew documentation](https://brew.sh/) doesn't do a great job explainig its capacity to novice users. I resisted to use it for years because I didn't understand the geeky slang that is spread all over the documentation. I will do my best to help you to:

- install / remove 
- install / remove macOS app
- upgrade package /macOS app

But before anything…

### Install brew CLI

### Commands that I use
